### University Projects
**Actuarial Analysis of the AUTO4+ Contract for SAssuranceS**

I had the opportunity to work on a team project within a fictional insurance company, SAssuranceS. Our mission was to conduct an actuarial analysis of the AUTO4+ contract, which insures over a million private vehicles, with a projection over a period of ten years.

Project Objectives:

1. Evaluate the need for a specific provision to anticipate any potential deviation in the technical results of the contract.
2. Provide essential data for drafting actuarial reviews regarding provisioning and pricing of the AUTO4+ contract.
3. Prepare a new pricing proposal incorporating the issues identified during the pricing review.

Focus on the Third Party Collision Damage Guarantee:

The Third Party Collision Damage Guarantee, automatically included in the AUTO4+ contract, was the main focus of our study. We examined claims related to this guarantee, with an emphasis on managing delays and complex claims.

Methods Used:

Descriptive statistics
